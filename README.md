## Hello, I'm David Clarke 👋

I am a biodiversity scientist based in Melbourne Australia. My work and research interests focus on the measurement and monitoring of biodiversity, with particular interests in spatial ecology and biodiversity informatics. 

Currently, I'm primarily working on Antarctic biodiversity with [Securing Antarctica's Environmental Future] (https://www.arcsaef.com). Some of my current projects relate to:
- Antarctic and Southern Ocean biodiversity responses to climate
- Integrated sampling designs for capturing data in remote locations
- Quantification and propagation of uncertainty in biodiversity modelling
- Assessing effects of taxonomic uncertainty on measures of biodiversity
